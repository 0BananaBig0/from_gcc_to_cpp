## Operator

### Explanation

1. Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables or values. They allow concise data
   manipulation, comparisons, and control of program logic.
2. Operators follow specific rules of precedence and associativity to determine the order of
   evaluation in complex expressions.
3. Additionally, operators can be overloaded for custom behavior in user-defined types, improving
   code flexibility and reusability.
4. In fact, it's **a function**. It makes our code clearer.

### Categories

1. Arithmetic Operators
   - Perform basic mathematical operations.
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)
2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
   - Compare two values and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`).
   - `==` (Equal to)
   - `!=` (Not equal to)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators
   - Combine or invert boolean expressions.
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)
4. Bitwise Operators
   - Perform bit-level operations on integral values.
   - `&` (AND)
   - `|` (OR)
   - `^` (XOR)
   - `~` (Complement)
   - `<<` (Left shift)
   - `>>` (Right shift)
5. Assignment Operators
   - Assign values to variables, sometimes performing operations during assignment.
   - `=` (Simple assignment)
   - `+=` (Add and assign)
   - `-=` (Subtract and assign)
   - `=` (Multiply and assign)
   - `/=` (Divide and assign)
6. Unary Operators
   - Operate on a single operand.
   - `++` (Increment)
   - `--` (Decrement)
   - `+` (Unary plus)
   - `-` (Unary minus)
7. Ternary Operator
   - A compact form of an `if-else` statement.
   - `? :` (Conditional operator)
8. Type Casting Operators
   - Convert one data type to another.
   - `static_cast`
   - `dynamic_cast`
   - `const_cast`
   - `reinterpret_cast`
9. Comma Operator (`,`)
   - Evaluates multiple expressions from left to right, returning the value of the last expression.
10. Member Access Operators
    - Access members of classes or objects.
    - `.` (Direct member access)
    - `->` (Indirect member access through a pointer)
11. Memory Management Operators
    - Allocate and deallocate dynamic memory.
    - `new` (Allocates memory)
    - `new[]` (Allocates memory for arrays)
    - `delete` (Deallocates memory)
    - `delete[]` (Deallocates memory for arrays)
12. Sizeof Operator
    - Returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or object.
    - `sizeof`

### Operator Overloading

#### Syntax

```CPP
RetType operatorSymbol( para_list );
```

#### Explanation

1. Operator overloading allows you to **define custom behavior for operators** (e.g`.`, `+`, `-`,
   `=`, etc.) when they are used with user-defined types (classes or structs).
1. The `RetType` depends on **the output of the operator** which you want to overload. The
   `para_list` depends on **the inputs to the operator and the object** you want to operate on.

#### Copy-assignment Operator

##### Default Copy-assignment Operator

###### Syntax

```CPP
ClassName& operator=( const ClassName& ) = default;
```

###### Explanation

1. The default copy-assignment operator is **generated by the compiler** if **no user-defined
   copy-assignment operator** is provided.
2. It handles **shallow copies**, which may lead to issues like **double deletion** if pointers are
   involved.
3. The `= default` syntax **explicitly requests** the compiler to generate the **default
   copy-assignment operator**.

##### Copy-assignment Operator Overloading

###### Syntax

```CPP
ClassName& operator=( const ClassName& other ) {
   // Custom copy logic here
   return *this;
}
```

###### Explanation

1. The copy-assignment operator can be overloaded to handle **deep copies**, manage resources
   appropriately, and perform self-assignment checks.

#### Move-assignment Operator

##### Default Move-assignment Operator

###### Syntax

```CPP
ClassName& operator=( ClassName&& ) = default;
```

###### Explanation

1. The default move-assignment operator is **generated by the compiler** if **no user-defined
   copy-assignment operator** is provided.
2. It handles **shallow moves**, which may lead to issues like **double deletion** if pointers are
   involved.
3. The state of the moved-from object is unspecified but valid after the operation.
4. The `= default` syntax **explicitly requests** the compiler to generate the **default
   move-assignment operator**.

##### Move-assignment Operator Overloading

###### Syntax

```CPP
ClassName& operator=(ClassName&& other) noexcept {
    // Custom move logic here
    return *this;
}
```

###### Explanation

1. The move-assignment operator can be overloaded to control how resources are transferred between
   objects.
2. It handles **deep moves**, which deals with issues like **double deletion** if pointers are
   involved.

#### Conversion Operator

##### Conversion Operator Overloading

##### Syntax

```CPP
operator TargetType() const {
    // Custom conversion logic here
}
```

##### Explanation

1. The conversion operator specifies **how to convert an object of the class to a designated target
   type**, which can be beneficial for implicit conversions or explicit type casting.
2. **Implicit Conversion**: If defined, the conversion can occur automatically in certain contexts
   (e.g., passing an object to a function expecting a different type).
3. **Explicit Conversion**: If marked with `explicit`, the conversion will only occur when
   explicitly requested, thus preventing unintended conversions.
