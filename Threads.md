## Threads

### Explanation

1. C++ provides native support for **multithreading** through **the `<thread>` library**, allowing
   programs to execute tasks concurrently on multiple cores.
2. A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by
   the scheduler. C++ uses the `std::thread` class to create and manage threads.

#### `std::thread`

##### Explanation

1. `std::thread` is **a class** that represents **an individual thread of execution**.
2. A thread of execution is **a sequence of instructions** that can be executed **concurrently**
   with other such sequences in multithreading environments, while **sharing a same address space**.
3. An initialized thread object represents an active thread of execution; Such a thread object is
   `joinable`, and has a unique `thread id`.
4. A default-constructed (non-initialized) thread object is not `joinable`, and its `thread id` is
   common for all non-`joinable` threads.
5. A `joinable` thread becomes not `joinable` if moved from, or if either `join` or `detach` are
   called on them.

##### Declaration Syntax

```CPP
std::thread thread_name;
```

##### Initialization Syntax

```CPP
// Default constructor.
std::thread thread_name;
```

```CPP
// Initialization constructor.
std::thread thread_name( funName, arg_list_of_funName );
```

```CPP
// Initialization constructor.
std::thread thread_name( fun_ptr, arg_list_of_fun_ptr );
```

```CPP
// Initialization constructor.
std::thread thread_name( a_lambad_func, arg_list_of_the_lambad_func );
```

```CPP
// Move constructor.
std::thread thread_name1( ... );
std::thread thread_name2( std::move( thread_name1 ) );
```

```CPP
// Move constructor.
std::thread thread_name1( ... );
std::thread thread_name2 = std::move( thread_name1 );
```

### `std::this_thread`

#### Explanation

1. The `std::this_thread` **namespace** provides utilities for **interacting with the current thread
   of execution**.
2. It contains functions to **retrieve the threadâ€™s ID, pause execution, or yield to other
   threads**.

#### Links

1. [`std::this_thread` in cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/reference/thread/this_thread/).
2. [`std::this_thread` in cppreference](https://cplusplus.com/reference/thread/this_thread/).

#### `std::thread::get_id`

##### Explanation

1. **Retrieves the ID** of the current thread, which is helpful for **debugging or logging**
   purposes.

##### Syntax

```CPP
// Its declaration syntax.
// Might be larger than time due to its overhead.
std::thread::id get_id() noexcept;
```

#### `std::thread::sleep_for`

##### Explanation

1. **Blocks the execution** of the current thread for **at least the specified `sleep_duration`**.

##### Syntax

```CPP
// Its declaration syntax.
template< class Rep, class Period >
void sleep_for( const std::chrono::duration< Rep, Period >& sleep_duration );
```

#### `std::thread::sleep_until`

##### Explanation

1. **Blocks the execution** of the current thread **until specified `sleep_time`** has been
   **reached**.

##### Syntax

```CPP
// Its declaration syntax.
template< class Clock, class Duration >
void sleep_until(
   const std::chrono::time_point< Clock, Duration >& sleep_time );
```

#### `std::thread::yield`

#### Explanation

1. **Provides a hint** to the implementation to **reschedule the execution of threads**, allowing
   other threads to run.

##### Syntax

```CPP
// Its declaration syntax.
void yield() noexcept;
```

#### `std::async`

##### Explanation

1. `std::async` is **a template function** that calls `F` (with `Args` as arguments) at some point,
   returning without waiting for the execution of `F` to complete.
2. The **value returned** by `F` can be **accessed through the `future` object** returned (by
   **calling its member `future::get`**).
3. **The second version** (2) lets the caller **select a specific launching policy**, while **the
   first version** (1) uses **automatic selection**, as if calling (2) with
   `launch::async`|`launch::deferred` as policy.

##### Syntax

```CPP
// Declaration syntax
// The first version
template< class F, class... Args >
std::future< /* see below */ > async( F&& f,
                                      Args&&... args );   // (since C++11)
```

```CPP
// Declaration syntax
// The second version
template< class F, class... Args >
std::future< /* see below */ > async( std::launch policy,
                                      F&& f,
                                      Args&&... args );   // (since C++11)
```

```CPP
// Usage syntax
std::future< RetType > obj_name = std::async( ... );
```

2. [`std::async` in cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async).

###### Launching Policies

1. **Asynchronous** (`launch::async`): Launches a new thread to call `F` (as if a `thread` object is
   constructed with `F` and `Args` as arguments, and accessing the shared state of the returned
   `future` joins it).
2. **Deferred** (`launch::deferred`): The call to `F` is deferred until the shared state of the
   returned `future` is accessed (with `wait` or `get`). At that point, `F` is called and the
   function is no longer considered deferred. When this call returns, the shared state of the
   returned `future` is made ready.
3. **Automatic** (`launch::async`|`launch::deferred`): The function chooses the policy automatically
   (at some point). This **depends on the system and library implementation**, which generally
   optimizes for the current availability of concurrency in the system.
4. Particular library implementations may support additional launching policies, with the proper
   label defined in type launch. Combining multiple values is possible, in which case, the function
   automatically chooses one among them.

##### Notes

1. Pay attention to the lifetimes of variables or objects passed to a function executed
   asynchronously. Instead of passing them as references, it may be **better to copy them into the
   function**.
2. **Passing variables or objects as references** can **lead to issues**. Instead, **passing them as
   pointers** might be **a better option**.

### `std::future`

#### Explanation

1. `std::future` is **a template class** used to **represent the result of an asynchronous
   operation**.
2. It provides a mechanism to access the result of a function that runs concurrently, typically on a
   separate thread.
3. This allows a thread to **retrieve results at some point** in the future, **once the asynchronous
   task has completed**.
4. `std::future` is generally used in **combination with `std::async`, `std::promise`, or
   thread-based libraries**. It **acts as a placeholder** for the result that will eventually become
   available.
5. A `std::future` object **cannot be copied**, but it can be moved.

#### Syntax

```CPP
// Declaration syntax
template< class T > class future;         //  (since C++11)
```

```CPP
// Declaration syntax
template< class T > class future< T& >;   //  (since C++11)
```

```CPP
// Declaration syntax
template<> class future< void >;          //  (since C++11)
```

2. [`std::future` in cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future).

###### Member functions

1. (constructor): Constructs the `future` object ( Only default and move ) (public member function).
2. (destructor): Destructs the `future` object (public member function).
3. `operator=`: Moves the `future` object ( Only Move ) (public member function).
4. `share`: Transfers the shared state from `*this` to a `shared_future` and returns it (public.
   member function)

###### Getting the result

1. `get`: Returns **the result** if the result is **available**. **Otherwise**, **blocks the calling
   thread**. And **only** allows to **call once**.(public member function).

###### State

1. `valid`: Checks if the `future` has a shared state (public member function).
2. `wait: waits`: For the result to become available (public member function).
3. `wait_for`: Waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified timeout
   duration (public member function).
4. `wait_until`: Waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified time point has
   been reached (public member function).

###### `std::shared_future`

1. **The class template** `std::shared_future` provides a mechanism to access the result of
   asynchronous operations, similar to `std::future`, except that **multiple threads are allowed to
   wait for the same shared state**. Unlike `std::future`, which is only moveable (so only one
   instance can refer to any particular asynchronous result), `std::shared_future` is **copyable**
   and **multiple shared future objects** may **refer to the same shared state**.
2. **Access to the same shared state from multiple threads** is safe if each thread does it through
   its own copy of a `shared_future` object.
3. [`std::shared_future` in cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/reference/future/shared_future/).
4. [`std::shared_future` in cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_future).

###### Differences Between std::future and std::shared_future

1. Ownership:
   - `std::future`: Sole ownership of the result.
   - `std::shared_future`: Shared ownership; multiple instances can access the same result.
2. Result retrieval:
   - `std::future`: The result can only be retrieved once using `get()`.
   - `std::shared_future`: The result can be retrieved multiple times by different instances.
3. Copyability:
   - `std::future`: Non-copyable but movable.
   - `std::shared_future`: Copyable and movable; can be shared across multiple threads.
4. Exception handling:
   - Both: If the asynchronous task throws an exception, it is propagated on the first call to
     `get()`.
   - `std::shared_future`: The same exception can be propagated multiple times across all calls to
     `get()`.
5. Use case:
   - `std::future`: When only one thread needs the result, and the result is used only once.
   - `std::shared_future`: When multiple threads need access to the same result, or the result needs
     to be accessed multiple times.
6. Conversion:
   - `std::future` can be converted to `std::shared_future` using the `share()` function.

### Notes

1.  A game typically loads different objects asynchronously and in parallel using multiple threads.
    This is why, at times, players can control their characters while some objects remain
    unresponsive.
