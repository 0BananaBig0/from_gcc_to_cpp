## Handles

### Explanation

1. Handles are **an abstract reference or identifier for a resource** (e.g.,
   file, memory, window) that is **managed by the operating system or runtime
   system**.
2. They allow **interaction with resources** **without exposing low-level
   details**, ensuring **safe** and **controlled access**.
3. They provides **abstraction**, **resource management**, and **cross-platform
   compatibility**.

### Types of Handles

1. File handle:
   - A reference used to interact with a file (e.g., open, read, write).
2. Window handle (HWND):
   - A unique identifier for a window or UI component in GUI programming.
3. Memory handle:
   - A reference to a block of memory, typically used for managing resources
     like shared memory.
4. Object handle:
   - A pointer or reference to an object, often used in object-oriented
     programming to manage object instances.
5. Database handle:
   - A reference to a database connection used to execute SQL queries and
     retrieve results.

### Usage

1. File I/O operations:
   - Interacting with files via file handles.
2. GUI programming:
   - Managing windows or UI elements through window handles.
3. Memory management:
   - Interacting with allocated memory via memory handles.
4. Database operations:
   - Executing queries and transactions using a database handle.
